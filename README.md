Developed a Java-based vehicle management program to efficiently manage and organize vehicles with variable numbers of wheels (e.g., bicycles, tricycles, and cars). The program includes features such as wheel size validation, vehicle creation tracking, and a unique cloning function for vehicles. Additionally, I implemented a convoy management system with a singleton design pattern, ensuring a strict limit on convoy size and wheel compatibility checks for seamless operations.
